Really nifty product for someone who works from home.
","

  Since I work from home, I often bring my work with me on the road. I may go stay with my family for a week or so every couple months, and I really needed a portable second monitor that I could easily plug into my laptop.This monitor looks really slick, and the picture is great. The “magnetic mat” that it comes on is really easy to use once you get used to it.I couldn’t find this in the product description, but it does come with cables. It comes with a power adaptor and a USB-C to USB-A cable that acts as the power source. It also comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It comes with a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable as well, which is what I’m using to connect it to my laptop.One thing to note is that if you’re using USB-C to USB-C, then if the device it’s plugged into can provide the necessary power, then it doesn’t need to be plugged into a power source. If you’re using HDMI, however, then it also needs to be plugged into a power source, or the wall. I’ll also note that all of the cables provided are 3ft cables, so if you need something longer you’ll have to get it separately; which isn’t a big deal.

Super lightweight! Very clear image!
","

  Pros and ConsPros:*Excellent screen image. 1080P FHD, 178° viewing angles bring me an excellent experience! HDMI ports guarantee the input is high quality.* Inbuilt dual stereo speakers sound not bad! I used it when I use my phone to look at news/videos.* 2 USB-C ports, Mini-HDMI ports, can work with new type smartphone, computer, PS4, XBOX, and Switch very well.* Screen Protector materials are good. The pictures I add here don't use their protector screen materials. If I use it, I guess you will see a better image.* Plug and play capability, no drivers required* Beautiful packagecons:The only one disadvantage is my old iPhone needs to buy an adapter to connect this monitor. The good thing is that the adapter is cheap.Overall, I love this monitor!

The perfect monitor in mind
","

  What a coincidence! I just want to write about my experiences in these ten days. Today I found out that Amazon sent me an email asking me for a review.The overall situation is very good. I used to go to the hotel to work on TV when I was on business trips. Now all I have to do is plug in my computer and work in bed. 15.6 is the perfect size for my backpack.The amazing thing is That I tried to plug it into my power bank and it started up just fine. In my spare time, I use it to watch movies and play games. It's so light and small that I like it.

This monitor can not be used to stream most video content and the volume control is useless
","

  I bought this to use on our stationary bike. The plan was to stream YouTubeTV, Netflix, Work Out apps and other streaming services from my iPhone while working out. We wanted a bigger screen than what is available on an iPad. Turns out you can stream YouTube but that's about it.  Most of those other services are blocked when you try to stream them. I think it has to do with encoding of copyrighted material and this monitor not being HDCP compliant. I asked the seller but there seems to be a bit of a language barrier. Based on their answers they clearly didn’t  understand my question.Another issue I found is that the scroll wheel on the side can be used to change speaker volume but only if you drill into the menus every single time you want to adjust the volume. Otherwise the scroll wheel by default adjusts the screen brightness. There does not seem to be any way to set it to adjust the volume by default which I find to be an odd setup and very inconvenient. I connected an external speaker that I had through the aux port but oddly when I did that the volume controls on the speaker became inoperable so still no easy way to control the volume on this monitor. Im going to try and find an external speaker with an inline volume control but this is a pretty annoying problem for our application or for anyone who wants to use this as a stand alone monitor connected to any source of content. If you are looking  for an extra screen for your computer or laptop it may be fine but why have built in speakers if you can’t control the volume??Addendum: The seller got back to me and pointed out that if you push the scroll wheel up instead of down it will default to the volume control so that solves the volume control issue. in regards to the issue of not being able to stream most paid services from the iPhone I discovered that you can actually stream to this device from Apple TV, Roku, and Firestick despite the fact that the service people said that was not possible. I am don't know what the explanation is but you can stream paid streaming services like Netflix, YouTube TV, etc from those devices to this screen without any difficulty and they actually look great.

LOVE it

  I love this portable screen. it workes great. I run a lot of programs on my laptop and this extra screen space really helps. Great display and workes perfectly when connected. no setting to play with. I highly recommend it. I just wish it didnt have to be plugged into a power source and could run from the computer power.  other than that. I'm in love.

A perfect travel monitor
","

  Light weight and a very nice display. I don't use for gaming, I use for business analysis, and it's perfect.From what other users have written: the monitor stand is excellent IF you correctly fold it.  The pictures in the instructions aren't very clear, and it took some time, but once I got it figured out, it's rock solid.  If the monitor isn't solid, you don't have the case properly folded. The case also provides adequate protection for when the monitor is stored in a briefcase.I am using the HDMI input. The USB-C didn't work from my HP Envy laptop (I got a message ""did not recognize the device"").  I think I have USB-C v1.0, so that is probably why. The nice thing with C is you don't also need the power cord, but you do need it with HDMI. Not a big deal.I have zero complaints with the monitor and would buy another one if I needed it

GREAT PORTABLE MONITOR, BUT DITCH THE SCREEN PROTECTOR
","

  This is a sharp little portable monitor that is ideal for travel and fits neatly into a backpack. It comes with a protective cover that uses magnets to affix to the monitor. The cover can then be folded into a stand that supports the monitor. The colors are vivid and the resolution is excellent. The screen is only 15.6”, but this is no smaller than a MacBook and perfectly suitable for my work-travel needs. Setup is easy. The unit possesses an elegant simplicity. Even the box it comes in is impressive, almost an art object.My one caveat: discard the screen protector and “cleaning kit” that supposedly assists with its installation. The “wet cleaner” left cloudy residue on the screen that the teeny microfiber cloth wouldn’t remove. As for the flimsy protector, you’ll just never get all the bubbles out. The only thing that all the time I spent trying to get it to lay flat accomplished was to remove the aforementioned gunk. So take my advice: leave the screen in its pristine state and toss the screen protector and “kit,” because the folding cover is plenty protective.

Perfect size for my project, and excellent quality for the price.
","

  I bought this to retrofit in a metal briefcase I had laying around, along with a keyboard, an old steam-link, and a slot for my phone (to act as computer and TouchPad via Samsung DEX)For the price of this screen alone, I was basically able to build a full fledged gaming laptop powered by a standard battery bank.Since I didn't see any mention if it in the description, the power required is 5v 2.4a and so a measly 10,000mAh power bank will run it for about 4 hours.It comes with a screen projector, the magnetic stand/cover, and 3 sets of cables. A USB C Male -> USB C Male (for phone or laptop display output), USB A Male -> USB C Male (For power input), a power brick, and a HDMI Male -> HDMI MINI Male (for all other display input needs)

A well built portable monitor for those on a budget.
","

  First off, this is not the best portable monitor out there, but it's great if you're on a budget and plan to work outside the realm of audiovisual projects.  If you're used to a multi-monitor setup in the office or at home, you know how frustrating it can be when you're stuck with a single laptop monitor working remotely.  This is a decent solution without breaking the bank, but there are some caveats.  Overall picture quality is pretty decent, but the color range is limited and it's not the brightest option you can find.  You'll absolutely want to tweak the settings to optimize your visuals.  I definitely wouldn't use it for serious photo or video editing, but watching movies or using it as a portable gaming monitor is definitely doable.  Sound is seriously lacking with its on-board speakers, so you'll likely want to route your audio through your laptop speakers or headphones/bluetooth.  Menu controls are a little finicky at first, but completely serviceable once you get the hang of it.  For my usual office work, which is mostly spreadsheets, documents, CAD drawings, and the occasional photo cropping, it definitely does the job.  I can't say much about longevity since I'm new to this brand, but my experience has been great so far.  If you're in the market, this one is worth checking out.

Nice for the price
","

  It's a basic 1080p 60Hz monitor that works as advertised.  I'm using mine as a display for my Raspberry Pi 400.- The screen is not super bright, but ""bright enough""- The resolution is not super high, but good enough, especially on a 15"" display- It comes in nice packaging- The 5V input is convenient and doesn't take much power (< 2A)- Both HDMI and USB-C inputs are supported.- There are two USB-C ports and one is power-only - it would be nice if they were labeled.- One con is that you have to menu dive a bit to change the sound volume, assuming you can't do it from the connected device.

Easy to set up, great quality!
","

  Just received this monitor and I am incredibly impressed by it! It was incredibly easy to set up (took about 20 seconds!) and there is no lag between actions on this monitor and my laptop screen. The monitor comes with a lot of additional components - a screen protector, a protective case, two different connection cords, and a power supply block. I am excited to use it and see how long-lasting it is; however, it also comes with a 12-month warranty in case anything happens to it!

Works Great, Affordable, Clear, Easy to Use, Poor Sound
","

  I just got this set up, so I'll update my review later when I've put this through more usage... but my initial impression is very good.The display quality is fantastic. I've got it connected via USB-C from my Surface Laptop and it's fantastic. Plus, it's being powered by the laptop so I don't need an external power source. This is going to make my life a LOT nicer when I need to work in random places with my laptop.I plugged it into my Samsung S10+ phone via USB and was even more impressed. Like the laptop, it was powered by the phone and looked great. I'd never seen my phone on a display like that, but being able to launch Outlook and the browser from my phone was pretty cool. It felt like I was on a tablet. I'll have to play with this more. I only wish this display had a touch screen to really make it feel like a tablet.The device came with USB C and HDMI cables, plus an AC adaptor and cord -- so you're totally set unless you need some other connection type.  A+ for that.There's a simple menu interface like nearly all monitors have for brightness, contrast, color, etc. But I didn't need to tune anything. It was all fine right out of the box.It came with a ""smart cover"" that uses magnets to hold itself into place. It's decent, but I don't trust those magnets. The cover doubles as a stand for a couple pre-determined positions, but I wish there were more angle options or an actual kickstand.The ONLY negative is that the sound quality was very, very poor. The speakers are tinny and quieter than those built into my laptop. I didn't buy this for sound, so I'm not disappointed, but anyone thinking about using this to amplify their game/movies better think twice. Just don't do it. On the plus side, it does come with a standard headphone jack which I suspect just passes the sound through from USB-C or HDMI. I haven't tried this yet.

Love My Portable Monitor
","

  Delivery excellent. Packaged well. Received timely. Quality of the monitor exceeded my expectations. Price was decent and it had a coupon that I was able to apply to the order as well which made it nice. I read reviews on this product and several others on Amazon and chose this one because of the reviews, accessories that came with the product and t he features. I changed jobs and the new company did not provide another monitor to utilize while working from home so I purchased one to be able to be more efficient while working remotely. I have utilized the speakers as well on the monitor and they sound really good. Picture quality is good when doing Webex, Zoom and Team meetings virtually. I highly recommend this portable monitor.

Comes with all the cords you need!
","

  This is a great, light weight, non touch external monitor. It has three ports. One for usb c power. One for usb c media. One for mini HDMI. If you plug in power to the top usb c port, either from a outlet or an Anker battery pack, it powers the display and recharges your source device plugged into the second usb c port at the same time. It's awesome.The interface defaults to Samsung Dex when plugged into a phone but just navigate to ""exit Dex"" and it will simply mirror your phone so you can use DirecTV Streaming and other phone apps.It's seamless with windows.Again, it includes every cord you need so don't buy a bunch of other cords that you will end up returning like I did.Lastly, it comes with a great magnetic case that protects it and acts as a solid stand.Very well done item.

Good portable monitor
","

  This is a good monitor from a great company.  I ordered one of these and a few days later was contacted by the company to ask how I liked the product.  I told them about one minor issue and we went back and forth with some emails and then they told me that a newer model had eliminated the issue.  Then they sent me the improved model and told me to keep the old one which is absolutely usable.  I was astonished.  The problem I encountered was that the unit was not saving the brightness setting after closing down.  That was annoying but I then discovered that the setting could be quickly changed back by a downward scroll on the wheel on the left side and then a quick adjustment.  There was no need to go back into the full settings menu.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one of these if I needed it.

Great second portable monitor
","

  This monitor is very versatile and can be used either as an external second screen for a laptop or as a portable tv if connected to a streaming device or phone.I particularly like the usb C cable that provides sound, video and power to the screen, all in one cable. Very handy for using with MacBook or latest PC.The screen format is close to 16:9 which makes it nice to work with spreadsheets. Colors need to be calibrated but are fine overall.The sound quality is what you would expect from small speakers.The nice touch is the Smart Cover that allows the screen to hold in position but sometimes the magnets don’t hold the screen very well.

Picture quality is better than my laptop!
","

  Because the monitor is so inexpensive, I was worried the quality wouldn’t be good, but it’s amazing! The picture quality is better than my laptop, the speakers are super clear, and there’s no noticeable lag time. I travel a lot, and the fact that this monitor comes with its own stand and is so lightweight has made it so easy for me to work on the go. The bezel is also really thin (which I honestly didn’t realize I cared so much about until the one on another monitor I tried was huge). 10/10 would recommend

Perfect!
","

  I bought this portable monitor to travel with when visiting family and squeezing in a little work. It works phenomenally.  Thank goodness that it came with the cords because one worked with my work laptop and not with my personal laptop and visa versa. The picture quality was excellent. The cord placement is a little awkward but essentially it does as it proclaims and worked beautifully my whole trip. Once outside is open fully and I am free to travel more widely, it will definitely be coming with me. It takes up very little space with its slim profile and travels easily along with my laptop and other electronics. Definitely recommend.

Great Monitor For The Price
","

  This is a fantastic little monitor! I've mainly been using it as a second monitor for my laptop and gaming on my Switch. It also seems to work well with Samsung Dex. I am surprised at how good the picture quality is for a 1080p screen as it is very bright and does not seem to have any latency or major color inaccuracy issues. The built-in speakers are not very loud but are a nice bonus to have considering a lot of portable monitors don't bother adding any, especially at this price. Overall I'd highly recommend it if you are looking for a portable monitor that won't break the bank.

Although it doesn't an internal battery, it comes with a power supply cord & an HDMI cord to connect to an Xbox or PS 4 game controller.Absolutely perfect for movies, shows or just surfing the web.It comes with a magnetic cover that doubles as a stable stand to allow easy viewing with a screen protector to boot!

100% Incompatible with the M1 Mac Mini as a secondary monitor if using the the LG Ultrafine Display
","

  If you have the new M1 Mac Mini and an LG Ultrafine 5K display as your primary display you CANNOT USE THIS MONITOR. M1 Mac Minis only accept ONE monitor using a USB C connection and the LG only has USB C so that monitor is using the one allowed USB C connection. Using the Mac Mini's HDMI port doesn't work because you can't go HDMI to HDMI Mini port which is what the monitor has, having no full sized HDMI port (like most portable monitors to be  fair).Be warned, I have talked to Apple senior techs and there is no known workaround for this, no adapters that will allow the video signal to be sent. Nothing.

Few issues but great value
","

  Was really skeptical of buying this item. Most of the products on this category are not highly rated and have a few design flaws.While not perfect, this item gets the job done. The display is bright and colors pop. The included cables are near useless. Besides not having the cable I needed, the included cables are too short. The kickstand case is ok. Embarrassed to say it too me 10 mins to figure out how to use it.Some apps on Windows 10 (Divinity Resolve) had serious issues with this display. It slowed down the operation of Divinity Resolve to a crawl. Had to start Resolve first, plugin and power up the monitor next to fix the issue. Aspect ratio is also hard to work with in some applications.Despite these issues, I use it every day.

Perfect for Remote Work
","

  I use a second screen for remote work. I am usually not working in the same place for more than 2-3 days in a row, so I needed a screen as portable as my work laptop. This is lightweight with a high resolution, not like some other name-brand portable monitors out there.I spent $300 on a portable laptop monitor before this one that can't even hold a candle to this monitor. (On top of that, the $300 monitor felt cheap and stopped working after only 3 days.) The other reviewers are right. The display quality is crystal clear, and it's plug-and-play. Save yourself the heartache of getting duped by the other name-brands. Save your money and be satisfied with this instead.

Much better than expected
","

  tl;dr The KYY 15.6"" 1080P portable monitor is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations for a $159.99 portable monitor. Sure, there are monitors with better picture quality or build for more money, but at this price, this was an absolute steal.Longer review.The KYY 15.6'' FHD 1080P Portable Monitor was a good deal for $159.99 in terms of price point and features when I initially looked at it before buying. The product page is accurate in its features and capabilities unlike others with a lot of excess and useless information.I was initially looks at this portable monitor for use with my Nintendo Switch and an Elgato HD60 S capture card. It worked excellent when directly connected to the Switch as well as when used through the Elgato HD60 S to the Switch.The connectivity and controls are flexible and easy to understand, just from the product page as well as from the manual. The power button and control wheel are simple enough to use without any problems. There were no loose or intermittent signals when using the 3.5mm (headphone) jack. The USB-C power (cable and adapter) and HDMI cables worked flawlessly.I must note that I did not attempt to use the USB-C full function capabilities as I did not have my laptop with this capability nearby to test this, but considering the rest of the monitor's build quality, I assume that there would be no problems if connected to the appropriate devices.The included accessories have a good feel for what's included. The smart cover, the cables and power adapter, and the screen protector all have a quality feel that seems like they didn't skimp out much, if at all, with these pieces.The picture quality is sharp enough, and the color accuracy is good enough out of the box. However, it is advisable, like most other monitors, to adjust the monitor's picture settings to be more color accurate or suited to your own tastes. I adjusted the picture settings manually to better match the monitors I have with my desktop PC to keep consistent color reproduction as much as possible across this portable monitor and my three desktop monitors.The 3.5mm (headphone) jack outputs the audio with a clean signal to the Elgato HD60S as well as to my audio interface (Focusrite 18i20). There was no distortion during my typical use. The built-in speakers are about as good as any monitor. Cheap, tinny, and quiet quality but good and clear enough. It's just like a phone speaker. It's good enough to understand what's coming through, but nothing like a proper speaker or headphones will give.Finally, I will talk about my personal gripes with this monitor. Firstly, The picture quality doesn't have a good spot for contrast and sharpness in my opinion. I'm no expert, but despite fiddling with the settings, I never found a setting I felt fully comfortable with. Second, the monitor's smart cover is magnetic and can only hold the monitor with the KYY logo at the base. It's a minor convenience for my uses, but it would have been nice to place it upside down because the monitor can auto-orient anyway. Lastly, the 4' cable is short for my use case. Again, like my other two issues, it's more of a personal problem, but a 6' cable would have been nice.Despite my personal ""issues"" with the product, which are really just quality of life preferences, the KYY 15.6'' FHD 1080P Portable Monitor is an excellent product and well-worth the price at $159.99.

VERY IMPRESSED

  The first thing that caught my eye was the size. I mean, I knew the size but somehow it seemed bigger than what I expected. Next, was the metal and the weight it had. I know the modern tech world loves thin, but I honestly like things to feel solid. I loved the metal and it is not too thick or thin. I've been using it mostly with Samsung DEX with the included USBc cable. One thing to note if you plan to use Dex is that ALL USB C CABLES ARE NOT THE SAME. Make sure yours is rated for video output. I tried with a different cable (brand new) and got frustrated until I realized the cable is the problem, not the device.

Lepow vs. KYY Portable Monitor - KYY WINNER!
","

  I bought the Lepow Z1-Gamut portable monitor and KYY 16:9 portable monitor to try out which one I liked as the reviews for these were fairly similar to my research. The products were very similar visually with the narrowness of bezel and color/quality output. However, KYY portable monitor stood out to me more in terms of the screen brightness, price, quality and the material.Lepow also has 320cd vs. KYY 300cd and to me it didn't seem to be a difference. Instead, it felt frustrating in some sense to work with all the settings on the Lepow to get what I like and somehow I still could not get it to the quality I liked. WIth KYY I plugged and go and it was already great in brightness and quality so did not need to fuss with the buttons. The buttons on KYY feels nicer, bigger, and easier to push down if I do ever need to access the screen controls. At the time of purchase checkout for both items, Lepow was about $30 more expensive, and with everything being quite similar in screen and style and quality they output, saving the $30 mattered more to me, so very happy with KYY price too!I feel kind of indifferent with the ports and where they are located between the two. KYY monitor has all the ports to the right for the HDMI and Type-C while Lepow is split between left and right. Just wanted to give that a mention since it did not really occur to me when I was deciding on which to purchase. I am leaning more towards all ports on one side though, just so my work space feels less cluttered as I do need to use the HDMI to mini HDMI and the Type-C to USB adapter charger. But I can be flexible and can work around those and not something that is a top consideration of mine's.The Lepow cover magnetic pull was slightly stronger than KYY from what I felt and the cover gave a more plastic-y smooth, cool to touch feel. KYY's cover was more cloth-y and when rubbed fingers there is a slight resistance feel, which is also nice and won't move as much when in cover against a smooth glass-like surface. Then with the cover, like some reviews said, Lepow's cover does have some weight to it, making it ever so slightly heavier than the KYY monitor with cover. In terms of the idea of a something ""portable"" KYY device stood out more to me in that regards.In all, I use a 13.3 laptop and don't like using an external monitor to extend the screen anymore. So I like to work with a smaller font, screens, and have lots of things opens at the same time to look at. Having a 15.6 monitor makes such a huuuuuuge difference to the eyes! My personal laptop is 15.6 in and I definitely appreciate the larger screen.I am so glad I also decided to try out the KYY 16:9 portable monitor! I decided to return the Lepow one and get another KYY for my family to use on the side (and maybe share haha!)!

Fuzzy display, won't work in extended display mode  **SECOND REVIEW UPDATE**
","

  Fired up immediately once connected, but all it would do is mirror my HP laptop screen; would not show up as external monitor, rendering it totally useless.Also, the quality of the display image definition was very poor--quite fuzzy compared with my laptop screen, and no amount of adjustment made any improvement.Would definitely not recommend.  Am frankly very puzzled by all the four-and five-star reviews.  Will be returning it immediately, and will order a name brand monitor rather than screw around with another no-name cheapo monitor.  It will cost an extra $100, but for an all-day-every-day work setup, well worth it.**UPDATE**  Although the monitor was a disappointment, the vendor has been very responsive in discussing the problem.  They they are working on an improved model; we'll see.  But meanwhile they're sending me a free replacement--same model--to see if it works any better; and this after I've already returned the first unit to Amazon.  They seem like a good company, and I hope their next model is of higher quality,**SECOND UPDATE**  To their credit, the vendor sent me a second monitor to try out, free of charge--after I had already returned the first one via Amazon and gotten a refund.  They really are trying.  The replacement monitor was better in one respect: it was able to function in extended display mode, which the first unit was not.However, it still suffers from lack of clarity: it can only be made sharp at a resolution that makes it all but impossible to move objects between displays--windows are the wrong size, wrong onscreen position.  This renders it useless for my purposes.  The ViewSonic monitor I replaced it with doesn't have these issues.The KYY monitor also lacks a built-in kickstand, which the ViewSonic has.  The KYY unit relies on folding the slipcover to a certain configuration to act as a support--not nearly as convenient or stable as the ViewSonic.  Not a huge deal, but the ViewSonic kickstand is definitely a plus.BOTTOM LINE:  If you want a second monitor but don't need to slide windows between displays, the KYY model is probably just fine.  It is certainly cheaper than the ViewSonic.

This item, is very cheaply made
","

  This item, is very cheaply made, for the price. I needed a duel screen for school because I watch my lectures online and write out my notes at the same time. I have had the product for almost a week now and it's been one problem after the other. Installation was easy and very simple no issues there. Applying the magnets and downloading the drivers was smooth and the mechanics of the product are good. When plugged in I found that the second screen turns on and off here and there. This becomes increasingly annoying because this causes blackouts on both the duex screen and the screen of your laptop, so you basically can't do any work while it's happening. It started out only happening every so often so it was annoying but manageable. The longer I used the screen the worse it got.

ANNOYING
","

  Pretty disappointed. Just opened the box, set it up, and there's a dead pixel... **update** I've had it on for 8 hours now bc of work and the screen flickers and words jump. Super annoyed now. Trying to convince myself not to return it bc I need a second monitor. Not sure anymore **update** it's been a couple days, I've started hearing a high pitched buzz which sounds like a tiny mosquito right in your eardrum. So hard to focus when everything is quiet and that's the only sound you hear.... also, the magnetic cover suuuucks. The screen keeps falling out, slipping, closing on itself. Urg. Im going to be returning this as soon as possible...

May Not Work for All USB-C Ports
","

  I tested this monitor with multiple different cables and connectors, even a USB-3.0 adapter with display capabilities.  This monitor did not want to connect to my ASUS laptop USB-C port purchased in 2018.  The USB-C connection only worked connecting USB-C to USB-C with my Samsung Note 20+.  For everything else, I needed to connected through HDMI.  Will be returning as it does not serve my purposes adequately.UPDATE: Previously 3 star rating, updated to 4 stars for excellent customer service, although issue is still unresolved for me.  After returning the item, the company contacted me and decided to send me another monitor to test out.  There is no change in status to the above; my laptops and the monitor are not compatible for USB-C connection.  However, my Samsung Note 20 smart phone was still able to connect perfectly fine via USB-C.Note: I have tested monitors like this from another brand (that I will not name here) that have worked perfectly fine with USB-C to USB-C on my laptops, to include using a USB-C to regular USB 3.0 adapter that has video capability.I would recommend this to other people if HDMI is enough for you.  I don't have any recent laptops that have the latest USB-C for testing to give a solid recommendation for USB-C only connection; except that it works perfectly fine with my USB-C smart phone.  I hope this helps people.

Works exactly as I needed
","

  I purchased this external monitor to pair with a Microsoft Surface that suffered water damage. (The laptop still works but the screen does not.) It took a little finessing to find the right cord configuration, as my Surface does not have a USBC, only a standard USB and a mini HDMI. I tried a number of setups using the enclosed cords, but had to purchase a converter that for the HDMI cord that could then plug into the mini HDMI on my machine. (Thanks to KYY for the prompt and reliable technical support; if you are having any issues, look in the box for a little card with their contact information. It's a lot easier to work directly with the manufacturer rather than Amazon.) I like this unit so much that I got rid of the larger (non-portable) monitor I've been using at my home office and just work from the portable. (Work is mostly standard office tasks with some graphic design.) I do agree with some other reviewers that the kickstand is a little weak. But it packs up well and fits easily into my laptop skin. Would definitely recommend.

Great for Travel
","

  I travel frequently and did not want to keep lugging a real monitor along. This was the perfect solution, my work laptop is a comically small 14"" and I work in accounting so I cannot function on one tiny screen. My only complaint is the HDMI cable broke almost immediately but I can use the lightning cable and the USB cable. The case is also not that great as a stand, I bought an inexpensive one when I got tired of knocking it over. My job isn't one that I would notice a lag and I don't stream on it so I cannot speak to that. Overall for the price it was a great solution for me.

Could be be better

  Well, it works. The cables are all about short and supper finicky, the screen quality is pretty good, but not that bright compared to my laptop and the screen protector is came with is awful. The case is the worst part out of all of this, it’s strange, the magnetism is weak, it barely protects the screen and barely supports it in a standing position. Because of this, I haven’t actually taken it anywhere for fear of it breaking or getting damaged due to the poor quality case and it’s use is limited by the flimsy “stand” provided by the case, which means I’ll have to buy something else to stand it up. It works well as a second monitor, which is I guess the most you could ask.

Good product with major problem (Updated)
","

  Updated from 3 stars to 5 since their customer service team promptly sent a replacement and I haven't had issues since!This is a decent product for its price, except for one major issue I had that made it unusable (see my tragic tale below).  I probably gave it too many stars because I really want to like it and most everything else seems good about the product.Pros:-Great price-Very portable and light-Perfect size for travel-Easy to set up and use-Comes with multiple adapter cables-Brightness response time is fine for office workCons:-Has to be plugged in to be used (no internal battery).  Although, you can just plug the USB power cable into your laptop-Stand is a little finicky and only has one angle to set the monitor at.  This can't be stood up anywhere other than a stable flat surface.Major con:-Not durable, lasted 2 weeks before breaking.  I travel for work and carry this in my computer bag so I can set it up at my hotel room desk.  This worked great on my first trip and had me feeling hollywood movie hacker working twice the speed any normal human should perform at.  Delusions of grandeur quickly crashed back down to reality as on my second trip after only 2 weeks of owning the monitor, the screen broke.  This sent me back to using the just the laptop monitor like the one-screen peasant I am.  It put the monitor in a thick laptop case and then in my protected computer compartment of my computer bag.  I have been placing multiple laptops here for 2 years and have had no issues at all.  When I took the monitor out from the bag, the screen was broken as shown in the attached picture.  I assure you that I am very careful with my bag and didn't drop or bang it.  I realize this anyone reading this will think something like ""look at this idiot that dropkicked his monitor and is acting surprised when it broke"".  But I really feel like treated it with the respect that the newborn tech baby deserved from it's proud new gadget owning dad...  In case I really am just an abusive negligent father, I ordered another one to give it last try.  I can only hope it lives a long and fulfilling life, unlike my goldfish in Kindergarten that my little sister removed from the tank so she could ""take it for a walk"".  That said, since this is a PORTABLE monitor it I think it should be at least somewhat close in durability to the laptop I use with it.

Terrible display quality
","

  I mean the product works, but my low rating is due to the terrible picture quality. From the reviews here with pictures, there does not seem to be a dim screen issue so it's definitely just my screen, which is probably defective. Just take a look between my laptop and the screen. The color is off and the dimness makes it really hard to read text on the screen. I'm surprised the reviews are so good because I experienced the opposite.Update: My replacement came in and the quality is night and day. It’s much sharper, clearer, and brighter. Turns out the product I got the first round was defective. Really glad I got a replacement.

Excellent for Remote Working

  Working in an office where I'm used to dual monitors, it was a challenge when I would have to travel to work from another place away from my desk.  I used to have to try to pack up my laptop and desk monitor and I would worry about something happening to it.  This monitor is just the right size, came with a cover that keeps it safe. It fits nicely in my laptop bag, along with my laptop (not bulky). It connects up to my laptop or any device I may have (tablet or cell). The cords that it comes with connects everything together beautifully. I love that I can keep it landscape or stand it on end (portrait) to have a longer page to work with. I highly recommend this if you have to work on the go! Just what I needed. Thanks!

Quality Monitor

  I shopped around for months for a monitor to use with my Surface Laptop and settled on this one. The set up out of the box is easy. I did have to purchase a mini-HDMI adapter for my laptop, so be mindful of what ports your laptop has. But once I got that, everything else was easy. Love the portability of it. The screen image is sharp and the sound is great. There is no lag between the two devices and video play is great. I will use it mainly for a second monitor to work, but look forward to the break times when I sneak a movie or two. Highly recommended.

  Top things: Super simple to transport and stand up using the included case, you can power it for videos or gaming using a USB battery.The included USB-C works for working on my MacBook Pro 2018, working on the personal Windows laptop (both power the screen too), and playing on the Switch.The included HDMI>miniHDMI works for Netflix and the like from the Windows machine.Only downside is that both USB-C inputs could be display/power instead of just the one.

Regrets

  Got this on Prime Day for a great price, but I can't use it. It emits this horrible high-pitched sound, intermittently but often enough that makes me think it happens every time the monitor pulls power from my laptop. It is painful to my ears. Also, the screen brightness has to be reset each time the monitor turns on - so if you are like me and still shut your computer down at night, you'll have to reset the brightness every single morning.I'm considering returning - have to check the return window. So disappointed.

  I travel a lot. Using a large Notebook on airplanes is getting more and more difficult. On the other hand, once I get to the hotel, I want to use as large a display as possible.I have been looking for a companion display for my travel.This product is a PERFECT MATCH for this. I can now use my Surface Pro on the airplane and short meetings, then add this very light external display in the hotel, or show customers a presentation quickly.One other unique use case is to be in a Zoom meeting, and use the 2nd display to read emails or other important documents (some meetings are really irrelevant to many people except the first and last few minutes.).This display has excellent picture quality, is very light and thin. As a welcome bonus, it includes all necessary cables in a nicely packaged package.I'm very happy with the product. Highly recommended!

  Going in I wasn't expecting much from this monitor.  However, I was pleasantly surprised. It works great with my Nintendo Switch! The screen is nice and vibrant with no dead pixels.  Case is great and even detachable.  Comes with all cables necessary to connect to your consoles or laptop.  The only things I would change is the volume on the monitor is a bit low and the power cable is short.  Not deal breakers though as you can buy longer USB-A to USB-C cables and I use a headset for my sound anyway.  For the price, this is an excellent buy!

  If you are looking for a slim, light weight, and sleek looking portable monitor, look no further. The KYY 15.6in portable monitor is for you. All the cables you will need you need for it are in the box as well. (I included a photo showing what comes the box)They also included a screen protector and magnetic folding case. The only tiny issue I had was that the screen protector was a little difficult to install, but after working with it for a bit I got it put on. This portable monitor does not have an internal battery though. I was not looking for that but it was just something I thought I should mention. It is powered by using the USB-c cable plugged into your device or you can plug it into the wall. The wall adapter is included. Thank you again for the great product.

  Nice design but it simply does not work. I was excited to try tho monitor out as I have a large gaming laptop and wanted a decent size second screen for when I am away from home. This screen work well the first 3 times and then would lose signal intermittently. It also had a dim image even with the brightness set at 100. It then would not connect at all. I tried switching between the USB C and the mini HDMI to no avail. The monitor just stopped recognizing the video signal l. Switched to the ASUS MB169B+ and have not had an issue. Definitely go with the name brand. Not worth the frustration.

The speakers are decent but not quite as loud as the ones on my laptop, I have tried it on three different laptops with different connection types and all worked flawlessly. My Asus has a USB-C for power, but not display so I used the USB-C cable or the power block and the HDMI cable (I needed an HDMI micro to HDMI adapter because my laptop does not have a full-sized HDMI port, but I had one and it works great. My wife's HP has a full-function  USB-C port and connected with one cable. My Macbook Pro that I use for work was the same one cable connection. It's really light weight, but feels solidly made.

Very Mediocre - Poor Sound, Average Quality
","

  This device definitely achieves what it is supposed to, but after 20 minutes of using it it became clear that it is very mediocre. The screen quality is very average, and the controls to use it aren't intuitive. It's a shame that the USB-C ports are only on one side, having them on both sides would be really helpful to make the monitor placement flexible. The biggest flaw I noticed was the sound - it sounded super muffled even at max volume.When compared to other portable monitors on the market, I do still recommend this but only if you ABSOLUTELY need a second display. I definitely wouldn't use this for gaming, it would only be for productivity if I really can't get by without a second screen.

Since HDMI does not bring power, I had to power it with the 5v 2a brick and USB A to USB C which were also included.  Again, lit right up and worked as intended.  I cannot wait to take this with me on business trips to have a second monitor!!

Great for remote work
","

  I bought this to use as a second monitor for remote work. I was very pleasantly surprised with how clear the picture was on this monitor, especially considering the reasonable price compared to others I had been researching. The only downside (which I knew when purchasing in the first place) is the monitor view adjustment angles are limited. For long term second monitor use, I would recommend something that has a fully adjustable angle of display (so it would match the same angle as my laptop). But this has been absolutely perfect as a mobile option for remote work from home when traveling short term!

Excellent portable second screen
","

  Working from home during COVID has been a real struggle -- with all the kids around, I'm picking up and moving my laptop all over the place, and never had the ability to reliably use the same place. So I was lugging an old dell monitor around my house, wires dangling all over the place, and more than once really struggling to keep it in my arms at once.With this new portable monitor, it's like my office moves with me. I can fold up the screen, grab the cords with my laptop, and work from anywhere in the house with both monitors. The sound quality is good and the screen resolution works excellently. I hope to pick up a second one to do three screens in the very near future.

Terrible product shipped completely broken

Best Portable Monitor
","

  This is the best portable monitor. The company also has very good support. My original monitor came broken (the LED screen is sensitive, so please be careful) and they replaced it immediately no questions asked.As for gaming, this monitor is truly incredible and has clear image. It obviously isn't as good as my MSI, but this monitor is as good as a portable one is going to get and it is stunning. I personally use it as a second monitor to view my stream chat/OBS while I'm streaming. I highly recommend.

Compact and Efficient
","

  I travel a lot for work and needed an extra screen. This fits in my laptop bag with my laptop, and works great. I stopped using the Thunderbolt/USB-C connector and started using the HDMI port to send signal and powering it with a USB to Thunderbolt cable. Even though it *can* work with just a single Thunderbolt cable, both sending the signal and receiving power from your computer, I've had the most consistent success when sending signal over HDMI and powering from a separate cable sending power through the USB-C port. The magnetic cover works great for both protecting, and for propping up the monitor. Great product overall!

Nice quality, bright portable screen
","

  Screen is crisp and bright for a portable monitor, the case is also high quality and looks attractive. Another good thing is that the screen seems to operate with very low power as I can run it directly from a USB port on my Raspberry Pi 4 (your mileage may vary). The only small issues I have are that the USB C power and data ports are too close together and labeled confusingly, and there is a tiny bit of backlight bleed near the bottom but overall nice product.

It connects via the supplied HDMI or USB C cable and powered by a USB power adapter that is also supplied.

Awesome unit to add additional screen space

  Great product!!  non-reflective screen, portable, can use 1 wire for power and A/V signal (USB-C to USB-C on laptop), easy to use.  Allows me to be portable with my laptop, still having the convenience of having a screen extension.  If your laptop doesn't have USB-C, there is a Micro HDMI to HDMI provided cable as well, and you'll have to power the unit with the USB-C to USB power cable (to either a electrical outlet or a portable power bank).  Really cool to pull this out of my backpack when I'm away from office or home.

Super portable, too; I got a lovely little case that fits both the screen and laptop.

  Works great for gaming with the Xbox One S. It even runs at a higher frame rate than the TV does! We use it as a low-cost, minimal space method to have a second Xbox in the room for co-op. If your monitor is displaying in 480p with your Xbox, go to the Xbox Settings/TV & Display/Display Resolution and change it there. Crisp, smooth image after that!

The instructions were simple, had multiple plugs and all I had to do with plug and play.  The smart cover is a great add in and provides its own stand instead of having to go buy something.  So far, its exceeded my expectations.

  Honestly I'm amazed at the quality of this product for the price. The packaging was really high-quality, and provides all the necessary cables you need to get it up, running, and connected to your other devices. It even comes with a screen protector you can choose to install, which is quite nifty. The magnetic cover provides two viewing angles which work perfectly, and can serve to further protect the screen when stored in a backpack. This monitor works even better with a bluetooth speaker, creating a perfect experience for gaming! And it works perfect as a second monitor for my laptop, allowing me to up my multitasking game. The picture quality is great, what you'd expect from 1080P, and although laptop or other monitors may have better brightness, it's certainly has enough brightness to satisfy most. Also, the product comes with a very detailed and helpful instruction manual for how to connect the monitor to various devices, which I really appreciated! Overall, I'm very pleased with this monitor, and I'd definitely recommend it.

Great monitor for work but hdmi won’t respond.

  I left a question and got back the most clueless answer as if i didn’t read the under manual and plug the monitor In. My wife bought me this monitor for work. Works great with the lighting port on my computer and live that it just connects using one cord. When I connect the power supply, hdmi mini port just flickers the image on and off the screen so I can’t use it for gaming at all. I have bought another hdmi to mini cord and have tried it with my PS4,switch, and Apple TV and I’m still having the same issue. I have reached out to kyy by email and haven’t heard anything back. Great monitor for work so far lacking when it comes to gaming.

  Pros:It is very portable and easy to use.It’s pretty lightweight compared to other monitors.The audio is indeed very crisp.Cons:There is a slight buzzing sound that was easily fixed when we turned the brightness up however the brightness isn’t very good for your eyes.The screen protector was a challenge to install but in the end, it worked out.Overall I would recommend this monitor. We bought it to use with our Raspberry Pi cluster. All we had to do was buy an HDMI to HDMI cord and it worked perfectly.

So far, good portable panel
","

  Purchased this a bit ago for me to use when performing middle of the night maintenance windows (I am a systems engineer) that I need to be in another room so my wife can sleep, as well as for travel on the road. I have used it for hours at a time, and it has done pretty well so far. I have previously used my iPad with Duet to have a second monitor, but as i get older, things get harder to read when they are smaller.First used it on a MBP with USB-C, and the Mac powered it without needing supplemental power. Resolution was good, it's still a touch blurry (I have been fiddling with settings), and it had a blueish tint to it until I adjusted color. I am going to run my Spyder color calibrator on it to see if I can get it a bit better.My wife used it next on an older MBP with HDMI. It worked on her system as well - again, a bit of blueish tint we tried to adjust out (got most of it out). She absconded it for herself for her online volunteer training she does, as well as for her online music lessons.Have also plugged it into iPhone and iPad, and those also work. I have also plugged it into a Raspberry Pi 3, and it also worked in that configuration (using the supplied HDMI to HDMI-mini cable and the power supply).Speed is good - there is no lag to it at all. The stand, while it works, is a bit thin and needs a bit more tabs or something to keep the panel in position (it can get bumped out a bit easy). The speakers are kind of a joke...I don't know why they add speakers to these things (they have added speakers to some of my regular monitors as well, and they sound horrible). The monitor itself looks pretty solid - hopefully it will last. The plugs can be a bit loose, but not too bad.I purchased another one for myself, but a different brand. I want to see if the color is better.

I'm a huge techie
","

  As the title says, I'm a huge techie and a big gamer. I have used top-quality computer devices since high school. Even as we speak, I have 2 top of the line monitors (one not being used). I dislike using multiple monitor setup because I like to have my one main monitor sitting in the center. However, only using 1 monitor is a huge hit on productivity. This is where this little gem steps in. It is the size of a tablet, so it's small enough to sit on the side of my desk without me having to move around my main monitor.So far, I'm very impressed with this portable monitor. Its bezels are thin enough that the product isn't bloated in size compared to its screen size. The picture is clear and although the color is a bit washed out compared to my main monitor, I wouldn't expect same performance from something that costs a fraction of my main monitor.This will also come in super handy when I need to show presentations from my phone to my business partners.All in all, I'm very impressed and I'm glad I bought this. It seems like a quality product and although I do not know how it will hold up long-term wise, I don't see why it will all of a sudden fall apart.PS - I wrote this review with the browser on this portable monitor haha

A WOW for it's greatness!!

  Lets be straight: the picture quality, the design, those included cables, even the speaker amazed me!!I bought it for my small warehouse as well as the portability when I travel. After I connected it with my laptop, the sharpness and brightness and vividness of the display really exceeded my expectations sooo much! I would say it is not less amazing than any of those well branded products in the market! Of course, with a better price! Although the speaker is not the type you can enjoy high quality music or dolby sound effect etc, it is already at my expectation for simple youtube video purposes.I would say considering the price point it's at, it's definitely a great product worth the money and will amaze you after you unbox it.

  I'm a teacher working from home to teach my students virtually. This monitor is making that job bearable. First, this is a beautiful piece, really sleek lines, nice color and excellent case/stand. Secondly, this is a GREAT monitor! The colors are vivid and images are crisp. I have it connected to a laptop with a 4K display and I can't tell the difference between the two screens. I have had a portable monitor before, but this one even has speakers with independent volume control. I could not be more pleased with this and may need to order another one if virtual school drags on much longer.

Works with my phone. Yay!!!

  I have a OnePlus 7 Pro smartphone and I purchased this monitor hoping it would work with my phone to watch movies. I am happy to report that it works! I connected the USB C to my phone and then to the USB C on the monitor, turned the monitor on and unlocked my phone and my phone screen image was showing on the monitor. Yay! I immediately went into Google photos and played a video I recorded and it played on the monitor. I then tried Netflix, Prime Video, and my YouTube app and all 3 played movies. Anything you see on your phone screen appears on the monitor so it can be used for internet, gaming, emails, movies, etc..  I'm so happy that this monitor works with my phone. It was so simple to connect and use right out of the box. The screen image is crystal clear with a beautiful picture. Sound is decent, but has an outlet so I can connect external speakers. This is an amazing monitor at a great price. Since it's thin and light weight I'm going to take it with me when I'm away from home. Highly recommend!

Useful for Work, For Gaming, For Entertainment
","

  This monitor has been one of my favorite purchases so far. I've found many uses for it ranging from work, gaming, or just general entertainment.First, this monitor basically plugs into and works with most devices. I've connected it to my work laptop, my personal laptop, cellphones, and gaming systems and have had no issues getting it to work with any of these. The picture is great and depending on the device you connect it functions either as an extended screen for a laptop, as a mirrored screen for a phone for a larger picture, or as a monitor for a gaming system. Just make sure you go into your laptop display settings to set it to extended screen. The monitor is not touch screen and does not rotate its picture when you rotate the monitor but that was expected when I bought it and is a non issue.Second, it comes with several cords you will need for connecting it to other devices - mini hdmi to hdmi, type C/type C cable, as well as a type C/usb power cable and adapter because unfortunately it does not have its own internal battery. You can either connect it to another device or to an outlet to power it. It will run off of  the laptop or phone battery however the picture will not be as bright running off of a phone battery. Also, you will need an adapter to make a connection with iphones as there is no lightning cable connections. When using it on iphones you will also need to accept it as a trusted device. Everything else I've used it on didn't require you to do this. Since I use it on the go, I power the monitor through a portable power bank which works really well. The monitor does not drain the battery fast. If you have your phone connected to the monitor while it is plugged in to an outlet or portable power bank, your phone may also charge in the process.The best way to get everything to work is to make all of your connections to the monitor and then plug your device in last - laptop, phone, gaming system, etc. The monitor should automatically power on when either connecting to a powered on system. The monitor does have its own speakers which work well. It does have a headphone jack but if you have a phone or device plugged in where you can use bluetooth headphones they will still work, you just need to reconnect them after connecting the monitor.

   A great monitor!I connect this monitor to my laptop and set the mode. (User guide) Very easy and works great. (See photos) . So,I can see different windows at the same time.Also, I can extend my phone screen and play videos and movies, anywhere.So surprise!! Whatever the color display or performance.  (See photos)Brightness is excellent even if watching a movie in the dark.Full HD and resolution let the image true to life.Only 1.7lbs. Not to say about lightweight, and easy to carry around.Comprehensive my user experience, l love it.Just one point, I think it features 3 upgraded stable ports is not enough, better extra  one port, in case,one day this port is not working in the future.In the end, I can't say that is the best choice (I don't own another brand yet), but it is a good value for money.

  I needed portable monitor for my work and this looks good fit for my use.As you can see in my picture, I have Microsoft Surface Pro and it is little too small.I thought about using a regular monitor but since lots of people is sharing a office, that wouldn't be a good idea.Picture quality is very good. WAY better than I expected. Also it comes with a screen protector. what a great addition.My surface is not powerful enough to power up the screen and that is why I used HDMI.If you have a laptop with USB-C, you only need usb-c to usb-c cable.This screen is very thin. I have a Asus monitor and this is little thicker than Asus.I have a picture to compare those monitors and you can see they have almost same thickness.one more thing. all cables are included so I didn't have to buy any cables to use this monitor.Really good choice if you need a portable monitor with HDMI.

   After fooling myself with a small monitor I bought off of Mercari I decided to get an additional monitor I could actually see while using doing work. This monitor came up as a lightning deal in my search, I jumped on it and I'm soo glad I did!! This baby is BIG and I'm loving it!My husband and I did a test and hooked it up to the Nintendo Switch and it worked very well! Then I set up my work laptop and my personal laptop and everything syncs perfectly!

  I bought this portable monitor on Prime Day. My husband and I work from home and want to be able to travel and work remotely, but we both need a second monitor (he bought one too). This monitor is great. It's extremely easy to set up and works with a single USB-C cable on my HP laptop and my husband's Mac. We also tried it on an ASUS laptop and Chromebook and it works with no drivers or downloads with the provided cables. The picture is bright and clear! It's also extremely lightweight but feels really solidly made. The included smart cover doubles as the stand. and attaches magnetically to the display. I highly recommend the KYY K3 monitor (this is the model number), It was also very well packaged. I could not be happier with this purchase!

  I decided to travel to a couple of places this summer while working from home. My company sent me an external monitor to use but is too big to fit into my luggage when travel. After researching for hours on Amazon for portable monitors, I decided to pick this relatively cheap one. It is one of the lightest ones I could find, still with great reviews. I have used it for almost a month daily with no issues. The case/ stand that came with it is a bit flimsy but I bought another cheap stand on Amazon that works well with the monitor. Super impressed and having an extra screen really help boost my productivity.

  Have been researching for a while for an “on-the-go” secondary monitor - and this is it! It met all of my wants and needs, especially as a student. It’s light weight, has clear images and quality, and honestly increases my work efficiency. I also enjoy that it has its own speaker. The only downside is that there are lots of cords running through it and if you power the monitor through laptop it can drain your battery very quickly. But plugging it into an outlet or using your computer charger simultaneously can take care of the issue, no problem. I love this monitor and highly recommend it! Great quality especially for the price!

  This portable monitor is a great mobile alternative to multiple screen display! The display itself is larger than my laptop and I honestly prefer it over the actual laptop screen.

Especially now that working from home is more common, this is a very great option to have multiple monitors with you outside of the office.

  I received the product a couple weeks ago, and it has been working very well since I got it. I wasn't familiar with the brand, but I took the chance on it. I opened the package and was delighted to find out that a case and screen protector was included, and it was very helpful! Additionally, they also included an mini-HDMI to HDMI for my laptop, a USB-C to USB-C (for power), and another cable for direct power (if you don't use the USB-C power delivery option) The settings were a little finnicky to deal with but after that, the colors were great! The screen is actually beyond my expectations. For the price I paid, I would say that this is an excellent deal if it will hold up. Two screens are a game changer! Would purchase from this company again in the future.

  Had a portable monitor before but brightness is subpar. This monitor actually has decent brightness and good picture quality. Being able to drive the monitor with a single USB-C cable is a huge plus for me because the USB-C cable provides both power and video signal to the monitor and you won't need an extra cable for power(yes, my old monitor needs two cables). Build quality is good with metal housing and the included magnetic cover is easy to use. The integrated speakers need some improvement, but who need those anyway. Overall, a solid monitor to carry around with my laptop.

  It's a monitor that is extremely portable, without sacrificing picture quality.

Only concern is that the case/cover doesn't work that well as a vertical stand, but in 2 weeks of use the monitor hasn't fallen over yet, so it does work effectively.

  This product is amazing !!!! I wish I could get more products from this seller! I love how the monitor is easy to use and fits perfect on my laptop bag whenever I have to travel for work. I recommend this product if you’re in need of multiple screen. Most likely will purchase another one.

Everything is working fine under DEX
","

  I am using my Samsung note 10 with this portable  monitor to replace my personal PC. Everything is working fine under DEX. Even wireless under ScreenBeam 2. Couldn't be more happy. If touch screen  will be better, but it cost a lot more....

Great first impression!

  I’ve just gotten my monitor. I work remotely and would like to have a second monitor for when I travel (lol what a dream!) and a third monitor when at home. My company forbid installing software so this is the perfect fit. I emailed customer service and they responded very quickly (thank you Cassie)! Overall, very excited.

Must Buy

  Item arrived on time and monitor is perfect for my laptop because of the charger passthrough USB-C cable. Really good build quality and screen brightness are perfect. I would have to say that this is a perfect buy rather than rep[lacing your laptop display or a portable monitor in genera

Great for what it's made for

  I was looking for a portable monitor for home/school use with laptops, as well as a potential monitor for game consoles.  This product is great for both. Picture is nice and clear, speakers are decent.  For the price and portability I'll give it 5 stars.

Wanted to love this portable monitor
","

  I was looking for a decent sized and quality portable monitor to pair with my work laptop.  The size is great and all metal frame gives this monitor a good feel, but the screen quality just isn't there.  I thought it was average to begin with but it seemed to deteriorate over time, making it difficult to read text for any length of time.  As a result, I had to return.  If they can upgrade the quality of the screen, I'd be back in, but can't recommend this one at this time.

Big screen
","

  First of all, the size is awesome! I almost thought it was overkill. I didn’t expect it to be so big. I got this monitor as a gift so that I would be able to watch movies when I travel on a bigger screen versus on my phone, where I have tons of movies stored.I am going to write this review because I wish someone wrote one more specific on how to use it with an iPhone. After numerous attempts and trial and error, I finally got it to work. The key is, you will need an adapter,  lightning to hdmi. And you have to use the apple version, not a generic brand. I know it cost a little bit more, but if you don’t use the apple adapter, your movies won’t be able to play because of copyright. Even the ones you have downloaded or the ones on your Apple TV app.If you want it to be completely portable, you have to use a power bank. Otherwise you have to plug it into a wall, but then that’s not portable. The quality is nice and the sound is good. You have to go into a menu to increase or decrease the volume, but I use wireless headphones, and I can adjust the volume there.

  So far this has been a fantastic portable monitor - very lightweight, easy to use, with a crystal clear picture. A very nice addition to the work from home environment, allowing me to have a second monitor within easy reach no matter when and where I am working. Great product!

Perfect for Travel (Work and Gaming)
","

  My PC build is a super compact Mini ITX (in the LOQUE Ghost S1 form). I built it with travel in mind where I primarily run design and rendering software with gaming on the side. This monitor is slim, compact and perfect for when I travel. It's own protective cover/stand is a nice bonus too. The best portable 1080p 60 Hz monitor I've used thus far.

  This thing is fantastic. I had been thinking about getting one of these but now that I am going to be traveling more for business and I am such a "" two monitor person"" I knew I needed something. This thing went on sale for prime day and it is so good that I would pay the current regular price for it. Quality is great. It is very light and folds up and is thinner than my laptop and fits into the pocket with the laptop easily.  Easy hook up with USB-C to USB see and that’s one cable.  Highly recommend.

Great for traveling and remote work!

  This monitor fits all my needs: lightweight, easy to use and compatible with my devices.This is what I liked the most:1) I was concerned because I read some comments about the USB-C power cord, but they are long enough to work with without needing to buy any additional accessory.2) I didn't even need to set up anything: just plug and play and the monitor detects by itself the device.3) The monitor arrived before I expected, even if I live in Colombia.4) It looks sober and elegant.5) I also love the portrait mode for navigating into my mail inbox or editing large texts.I strongly recommend to but this KYY monitor to anyone who is looking to boost their productivity!

Best bang for $150 bucks on a monitor today

   I was skeptical at first, seeing a small brand writing ""pls"" with Prime overnight shipping. It seemed too good to be true. It was completely worth it. And if you aren't looking to drop hundreds on a full blown monitor, this will do the trick for a smaller college income living style.Quick impressions as Pros and ConsPros :Clean, crisp image, locked 60 FPSGreat color spectrum, flipping through from different games I was especially impressed by the pop and depth of greens, purples, and orangesRespectable dual speakers that had impressive volume15.5 inches looks a lot longer without the keyboard like my laptop is, but it is a great screen size.At 300 cd/m² it is surprisingly great as you increase the brightness the screen isn't flushed out in white fade. It helps the color pop to be above 90 is my personal preferenceThey include the power cable, and also the HDMI to mini-HDMI and a happy surprise USB-C to USB-C which is funnily longer than both other cords, which are a bit short for my setup but an extension power strip fixed thatSimple one button menu navigation and power button easily pressed but won't be pushed on accidentCons :One button menu navigation.Let me explainBit of a learning curve on how to use it, and I spent a while playing around with it to figure it out, but here is a helpful NOTE: pushing down opens the brightness volume, and pushing up opens the volume, and from there you can adjust either normally. Clicking it again closes the quick adjust menu, and the power button closes the full menu. ""short press to back to the upper page"" like the manual says means to click the power button to go back, since pressing the knob is to go forwardSound should not have had 0-100 volume range, as 30-70 sounds the same but you have to click all the way through it to get to either end where sounds does audibly change. 70-100 is small but noticeable increase and 0-30 gets noticeably quieter throughoutNo card to apply screen protector. I made pretty well with the edge of the instruction manual but as in my picture you can see the bubbles I'm still working out. I am happy to say it is not at all noticeable when the full screen is being used with my Playstation, just when I'm using my phone and it doesn't fill the entire screen.Play Test :I just finished a 2 hour gaming session where I tested to see how it would match up with the TV I usually play on. I played Call of Duty Cold War, Dirt 5, Final Fantasy 7 Remastered, and Marvel's Spider-Man. I was impressed by how sharp everything was, and the varying color themes of each game were bright and full. Great for gameplay, very fluid, and streaming as well is really nice. One odd issue I ran into was that my phone can stream YouTube while connected, but other services give an error message, while my Playstation can stream services like Disney+ but it cannot stream YouTube. Not a deal breaker since I prefer to watch most stuff on my phone as is, but important to note.Honestly it is the best $150 I've spent in a while, and worth every dollar. After using this monitor, on 1-10 scale I'm at an 8 that I would likely just buy this monitor again when this one needs to be replaced instead of spending $750 on a new monitor with all the bells and whistles.

  Compared with buying a $1000 Macbook, I chose to buy a $700 Mac mini + $ 200 27 inch desk monitor and a $ 150 portable monitor in case of possible trivials.The monitor is good, particularly it came with the screen protector and several cables to adapt my computers.It has a little light reflection, but it is fine for me.So far so good!
